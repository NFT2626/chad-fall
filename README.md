I have update the game by adding a palallax scrolling background behind the scene I've also changed the onscreen buttons its now 
* L: left 
* R: right
* A: jump 
* B: pause

"for touch enabled devices" keyboard keys are still the same.
the entities are using a new spritesheet from Kennys.nl
I'm still using impact aswell a powerful game engine.
